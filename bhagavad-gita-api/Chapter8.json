The conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is called adhidaivata.

The Supersoul is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or adhiyaj\u00f1a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul\u2019s activities and is the source of the soul\u2019s various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a, whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system."

A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one\u2019s thoughts during the course of one\u2019s life accumulate to influence one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one\u2019s next life. If in one\u2019s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is possible for one to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the end of one\u2019s life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is the best process for successfully changing one\u2019s state of being at the end of one\u2019s life."

That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is puru\u1e63a, a person \u2013 we think of the person R\u0101ma and the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And whether one thinks of R\u0101ma or of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what He is like is described in this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord is kavi; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (\u201cinconceivable\u201d) is very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world \u2013 so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding."

If one is always able to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in sam\u0101dhi."

Different processes of liberation have also been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. The principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of j\u00f1\u0101na, karma or ha\u1e6dha. As indicated by the word ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahma-jyotir or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, karma-yog\u012b or ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain."

The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years.

And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avat\u0101ra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, and the same number comprise one night.

The supreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees, called \u201cdesire trees,\u201d that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as surabhi cows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\u1e63m\u012bs), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (ve\u1e47u\u1e41 kva\u1e47antam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds \u2013 His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives only a small hint of His personal abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Vedic literatures (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (puru\u1e63\u0101n na para\u1e41 ki\u00f1cit s\u0101 k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 param\u0101 gati\u1e25). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana located in the spiritual sky. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, comprising about 168 square miles in the district of Mathur\u0101, India."

However, for the pure devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no fear of returning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or arrangement."

A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master.

These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya."
