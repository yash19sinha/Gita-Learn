        "purport": "In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge."

The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also study the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, written by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. The students of the Bh\u0101gavata school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b regulations, and therefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of S\u0101\u1e45khya and Ved\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities are better situated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although they too come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births."

        "purport": "One who is on the path of liberation by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no chance of his being deviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, \u201cWhy then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn\u2019t he in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work."

The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradh\u0101na. The Vedic hymns sarva\u1e41 hy etad brahma (M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya Upani\u1e63ad 2), tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma r\u016bpam anna\u1e41 ca j\u0101yate (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.1.9), and, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.3), mama yonir mahad brahma indicate that everything in the material world is a manifestation of Brahman; and although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one\u2019s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is then beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G\u012bt\u0101 (3.30), mayi sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i sannyasya: \u201cResign all works unto Me [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d The conclusion is that a person without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and should therefore be engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of the body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil."

He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\u1e47u, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, e\u1e63a u hy eva s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati ta\u1e41 yam ebhyo lokebhya unnin\u012b\u1e63ate. e\u1e63a u ev\u0101s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati yam adho nin\u012b\u1e63ate: \u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated.

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena, j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i and na hi j\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."

As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present both in the outcaste and in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present in each and every body. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction."

But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvara\u1e41. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."
